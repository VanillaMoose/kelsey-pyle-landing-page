This is my solution to TOP's project: Landing Page.
Along with brushing up on basic commands I have learned such as colors, font styles, and href links, I learned how the CSS cascade works as well as
figuring out how the flex funciton interacts with different elements of a webpage.
Through trial-and-error I was able to figure out how to compound certain commands to make unique items of the same class.
